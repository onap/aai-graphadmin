to add manual data, two files will be populated in the release directory under this folder. 
If the release directory does not exist, create it.

The addManualData.sh script requires the release to be passed
as a parameter. It finds and applies manual data changes under
the release folder matching the parameter.

This script is expected to be run for each installation. The script uses
the PutTool, and flags the put to ignore 412 errors produced
when the resource already exists.

100-<file>.txt will contain the resource to be put. 
100-<file>.json will be the json file passed to the PutTool.
