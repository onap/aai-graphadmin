# historyTruncateDb.sh  -- This tool is usually run from a cron.  
#    It uses the application.property "history.truncate.window.days" to look for 
#    and delete nodes and edges that have an end-ts earlier than the truncate window.
#    Or, that can be over-ridden using the command line param, "-truncateWindowDays".
#    That is - they were deleted from the 'real' database before the window.
#    So, if the window is set to 90 days, we will delete all nodes and edges 
#    from the history db that were deleted from the real db more than 90 days ago.
#
#    It also uses the property, "history.truncate.mode".  Can be over-ridden using
#    the command line property "-truncateMode"
#       "LOG_ONLY" - look for candidate nodes/edges, but just log them (no deleting)
#       "DELETE_AND_LOG" - like it says...  does the deletes and logs what 
#              it deleted (node and edge properties)
#       "SILENT_DELETE"  - not entirely silent, but will pare the logs way back to
#              just recording vertex and edge ids that are deleted. 
#
#    Ie.    historyTruncateDb.sh -truncateWindowDays 60 -truncateMode LOG_ONLY
