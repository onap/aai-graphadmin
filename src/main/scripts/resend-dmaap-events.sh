# resend-dmaap-events.sh  -- This tool is used to resend dmaap events.
#    On certain scenarios due to dns or other networking issue, if A&AI fails to publish events
#       We need a mechanism to resend the dmaap events for objects that haven't modified since
#       So if a pserver object event was supposed to be sent but got lost and a later dmaap event
#       was sent out then we shouldn't be sending dmaap messages
#       It identifies if a dmaap message was already sent by looking at the resource version
#       of the dmaap object that was failed to sendand checks the snapshot and see if they are the same
#
# Parameters:
#
# -b,  (required) <string> the base url for the dmaap server 
# -e,  (required) <file>   filename containing the missed events
# -l,  (optional)          indicating that the script should be run in debug mode
#                          it will not send the dmaap messages to dmaap server 
#                          but it will write to a file named resend_dmaap_server.out
# -x   (optional)          skip resource version check
# -p,  (required) <string> the password for the dmaap server 
# -s,  (required) <file>   containing the data snapshot graphson file to compare the resource versions against
#                          partial snapshots should be concatenated into a full snapshot file
#                          before running the script
# -u,  (required) <string> the username for the dmaap server
# -t,  (required) <string> the dmaap topic
#
# An example of how to use the tool:
# Please use right credentials and right dmaap server in the cluster
#
#  ./resend-dmaap-events.sh -e example_events.txt -s dataSnapshot.graphSON.201808091545 -u username -p example_pass -b https://localhost:3905 -t AAI-EVENT
#
# For each dmaap message in the example_events.txt, it will check 
# against graphson and try to send it to the dmaap server
# If the example_events.txt contains two events one that wasn't sent to dmaap
# and the other that was already updated by another PUT/DELETE
# and the output of the run will look something like this:
# 
# Output:
# Dmaap Event with Id 7f7d8a7b-4034-46f3-a969-d7e5cbcbf75f was sent
# Dmaap Event with Id 7f7d8a7b-4034-46f3-a969-d7e5cbcbf75f not sent
# 
# If lets say, there was a username password issue, you will see something like this:
# Dmaap Event with Id 7f7d8a7b-4034-46f3-a969-d7e5cbcbf75f was not sent due to dmaap error, please check logs
# Dmaap Event with Id 7f7d8a7b-4034-46f3-a969-d7e5cbcbf75f not sent
# 
# From the directory in which you are executing the script (not where the script is located)
# You can have it be located and executed in the same place 
# Check for a file called resend_dmaap_error.log as it will give you more details on the error
#
# For testing purposes, if you are trying to run this script and don't want to actually
# send it to a dmaap server, then you can run either of the following:
#
# ./resend-dmaap-events.sh -l -e example_events.txt -s dataSnapshot.graphSON.201808091545 -t <other-dmaap-topic>
# or
# ./resend-dmaap-events.sh -l -e example_events.txt -s dataSnapshot.graphSON.201808091545 -u username -p example_pass -b https://localhost:3905 -t <other-dmaap-topic>
# or, to skip the resource-version check
# ./resend-dmaap-events.sh -l -x -e example_events.txt -s dataSnapshot.graphSON.201808091545 -u username -p example_pass -b https://localhost:3905 -t <other-dmaap-topic>
#
# Following will output what would have been sent out based on checking the datasnapshot with example_events.txt
#
# Output:
# Dmaap Event with Id 7f7d8a7b-4034-46f3-a969-d7e5cbcbf75f was sent
# Dmaap Event with Id 7f7d8a7b-4034-46f3-a969-d7e5cbcbf75f not sent
#

# would have been sent out in the current directory where you are executing this script
